h2:assignment Assignment
h3:question-1a-extract-winneshiek-county-corn-yields-fit-a-linear-time-trend-make-a-plot.-is-there-a-significant-time-trend Question 1a: Extract Winneshiek County corn yields, fit a linear time trend, make a plot. Is there a significant time trend?
h3:question-1b-fit-a-quadratic-time-trend-i.e.-year-year2-and-make-a-plot.-is-there-evidence-for-slowing-yield-growth Question 1b: Fit a quadratic time trend (i.e., year + year^2) and make a plot. Is there evidence for slowing yield growth?

Question 2 – Time Series: Let’s analyze the relationship between temperature and yields for the Winneshiek County time series. Use data on yield and summer avg Tmax. Is adding year or Tmax^2 to your model helpful? Make a plot and interpret the results.
h3:question-3-cross-section-analyze-the-relationship-between-temperature-and-yield-across-all-counties-in-2018.-is-there-a-relationship-interpret-the-results. Question 3 – Cross-Section: Analyze the relationship between temperature and yield across all counties in 2018. Is there a relationship? Interpret the results.

Question 4 – Panel: One way to leverage multiple time series is to group all data into what is called a  regression. Convert the county ID code ( or ) into factor using as.factor, then include this variable in a regression using all counties’ yield and summer temperature data. How does the significance of your temperature coefficients (Tmax, Tmax^2) change? Make a plot comparing actual and fitted yields and interpret the results of your model.

Question 5 – Soybeans: Download NASS data on soybean yields and explore either a time series relationship for a given county, the cross-sectional relationship for a given year, or a panel across all counties and years.
