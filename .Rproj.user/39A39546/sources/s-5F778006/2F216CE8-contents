# Chapter 1: Introduction to RMarkdown through the Poudre

## Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")
```



## Assignment. 

### DyGraph example. 

```{r}

dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyAxis("x", label = "Time")%>%
   dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2)
```


### Poudre Paragraph

Colorado's Front Range would not be the same without the critical flow of the Cache la Poudre (*POO-der*) River. The headwaters begin high in the Rocky Mountains, initiating a 125-mile journey (https://poudreheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/poudremapgeneral-1.jpg) that drops an astounding **7,000 feet** of elevation on its way to the grasslands of northeastern Colorado. As with many of Colorado's major rivers, the 'Poudre' has played a crucial role in the development of agriculture, economy, recreation, and even water laws- more on this here (https://poudreheritage.org/water-war-and-law/). A ride up the Poudre River Canyon from Fort Collins will quickly reveal the impact that the river has had on the geology of the region. **Steep** drop-offs (https://coloradoencyclopedia.org/sites/default/files/Cache_la_Poudre_River_02.jpg) play host to numerous ecosystem types, and consequently, a variety of organisms including mountain mahogany, sagebrush, bighorn sheep, and even **mountain lions**. The importance of this river is difficult to overstate, so conservation of this beauty must remain a focal point of local communities' agendas.
